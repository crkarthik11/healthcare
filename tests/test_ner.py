    "For the past few days, I've been feeling a strange numbness in my left arm and hand. It comes and goes but it's starting to worry me. Is this something I should get checked out?",
    "I've had a persistent cough for about two weeks and it's not getting better. With the current COVID-19 situation, I'm really worried. What should I do?",

    "I've had a sore throat for a while now and it's becoming increasingly difficult to swallow. I also have a feeling of a lump in my throat. What could this be?",
    "I've noticed that I've been urinating much more frequently than usual for the past week or so. It's starting to interfere with my daily activities. What could be causing this?",
    "I have a persistent cough that's been keeping me up at night for the past two weeks. I've tried over-the-counter cough medicine but it's not helping. What should I do?",
